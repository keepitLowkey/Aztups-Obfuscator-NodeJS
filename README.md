# Aztups-Obfuscator-NodeJS

```
Credits goes to Aztup for modifying Defcon's Iron Brew obfuscator.
Also to CharWar for encouraging me to release this version.
```

```
You must have Node.js installed.

To run this, make sure you have your scripts in the `Scripts` folder.
Step 1: `npm install`
Step 2: `npm start` to start the obfuscation.
All of the scripts from your `Scripts` folder will be outputted into `Obfuscated Scripts`
```
